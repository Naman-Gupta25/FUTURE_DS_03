#🎯 Objectives

✔️ Load, clean, and preprocess raw student feedback data

✔️ Identify correlation patterns among key teaching factors

✔️ Engineer a Total Satisfaction Score metric

✔️ Visualize insights using heatmaps and plots

✔️ Present data-driven recommendations for academic improvements

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

🐍 Python

📦 Pandas, NumPy

📊 Matplotlib, Seaborn

🧹 Data Cleaning Techniques

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#📑 Process Workflow
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for exploration.

2. Data Cleaning

Checked for missing values

Removed duplicates

Standardized column names

3. Feature Engineering

Calculated the Total Satisfaction Score by averaging all feedback-related metrics.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis

Generated a correlation heatmap to examine relationships

Visualized each parameter’s distribution

Interpreted positive and negative correlations

5. Insight Extraction

Identified key drivers of satisfaction and areas requiring improvement.
